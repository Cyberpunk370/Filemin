-- Version 0.9.2 --
 - Switched to Webmin functions for HTTP/FTP Download, so download progress is shown now. Got rid of File::Fetch dependecy in module code.
 - HTTP/FTP Download now prompts for username and password on remote server, if any required user can provide it.
 - Removed "openlayers" folder. How did it get in here???? :D
 - Completely rewrote upload.cgi. Now upload progress is shown with Webmin`s upload tracker.
   Memory usage is low due to direct HD write, even with REALLY big uploads(tested with 3 files totalling 1.61 GB).
   BEWARE: if user reaches his/her disk quota then Webmin simply resets connection with no errors, can do nothing with it right now.
 - Fixed "select-unselect" checkbox behavior for old themes.
 - Updated russian translation.
 - THE LONG WAITED! THE MOST WANTED! THE ONE AND ONLY - ACL!!!
   Default ACL behavior sets only one ACL entry '$HOME' for each user. This locks user in $HOME directory.
   To grant full FS access to user replace '$HOME' with '$ROOT' in user`s ACL.
   If there`s only one entry in ACL then it counts as "home" or "chroot", otherwise user will see accessible dirs relative to "/", just like it is in old FM.
   Avoid trailing slash in ACL entries: "/usr/share/webmin" - gooooood, "/home/test/" - baaaaad.
   Root bypasses ACL completely.
   Note that even though user can be granted full FS access, he still works with his own privileges.
   So anything that requires "root" permissions or "sudo" won't work.
 - Folders go first.
   Rewrote directory listing procedure, now folders appear before files in list as in any other adequate file manager.
   As a result first and second entry in '/' are now visible :)
   Note that sorting table with javascript under Authentic or Framed themes will mix everything again until page reload ;-)
 - Major code cleanup of rendering procedure.
 - Fixed copy/cut/paste functionality.
 - FreeBSD support added.
   Module uses Regexp::Common and URI packages to validate URIs in HTTP/FTP download functionality.
   Be sure to install theese to make functionality work.
   Admin user created during Webmin installation is not UNIX user, so module won't work for him.
   If you want to provide some "system" file operations then convert "root" to Webmin user.

  #11 fixed:
 - CRLF is replaced with UNIX style LF while saving a file.

-- Version 0.9.1 --
#8 fixed:
 - Not sure if it was an issue, cause I was unable to reproduce "User without $HOME" scenario. However added some code to handle this, just in case.
 
#7 fixed:
 - Removed Archive::* dependencies, all archive extraction procedures now go through system calls. *.tar.gz, *.tar.xz, *.tar.bz2, *.zip archive types tested.

#6 fixed:
 - Switched to Regexp::Common for URI validation in "HTTP Download" operation to avoid additional dependencies.

#5 fixed:
 - Added HDD icon for "/" while under root for legacy themes.

 - Added BWTheme support.
 - Changed license to BSD style.
 - Chown now asks for group too.
 - Slight interface improvements for modern dialogs.
 - Major interface imprevements for legacy dialogs, jQuery and jQueryUI shipped with the module for this purpose.
 - Added $in{'...'} parameters check in some operations to prevent errors if user submits emtpy form by hitting "Enter".
 - Changed textarea font to monospace.
 - Added sticky bit and setgid to chmod.
 - Chmod and chown can be done recursively.
 - Made list table more compact for Bootstrap enabled themes.
 - Removed group column, group is displayed now within "Owner User" column: "root:root", "realgecko:users" etc.
 - Modified date/time display format for better sorting under Authentic theme.
 - Added "Refresh" quick button for modern themes, just for fun :D
 - Added a work around to fix JS hell provided by Framed Theme family with "onmouseover" and "onmouseout" events, that led to unselectable rows by "Select All" and "Inverse Selection" operations.
 - Using the same class to highlight rows as Authentic.
 - Moved icons to images folder, as Authentic Theme author improved third party modules' files handling.
 - Added .deb package for distribution flexibility.
